# Automate End of Duty Tasks

The script searches the DNAnexus for recently created production projects '002_' and generates download links that are saved to a .csv file. 

An email is sent to the Duty Bioinformatician with instructions on how to download the files to the appropriate locations on the GST-Trust network. 

The script supports the following projects:

* WES
* TSO500
* SNP
* MokaPipe
